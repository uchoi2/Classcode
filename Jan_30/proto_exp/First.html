        Round {{ group.round  }}
        You are the first mover.
        Your payoff is determined as the average of the payoffs of two second movers
        You have 10 number of tokens to allocate between the asset A and the asset B
        You get $ {{ player.signal }} as a signal for the value of the asset A.
        A noise is equally likely ranging from -$10 to $10.
        Hence, the real value of the asset A is surely within the range from {{ player.lower }} to {{ player.upper }}.
        The value of the asset B is $125 surely.

        How many tokens would you allocate to the asset A? Write down the integer number between 0 and 10 in the following blank.
