        Welcome to the ExCEN Lab.

        1. Round and Group
        The total number of rounds id 20.
        Each group consists of three people: One first mover and two second movers.
        Every round, you are randomly reassigned with two other people.

        2. Assets
        There are two types of assets: Asset A and Asset B.
        The value of asset A is equally likely drawn from $90 to $160 before starting each round.
        The value of asset B is fixed at $125.
        The real value of the asset A is not known to you and your group members.

        3. Role
        In the experiment, you will be assigned the one of two roles: the first mover and the second mover
        Your role is fixed for the entire rounds.
        The first mover will be given 10 number of tokens.
        Each token represents 10% of the total share of each asset in a payoff.
        The first mover will choose the number of the tokens being allocated to the asset A.
        The rest of the tokens are automatically assigned to the asset B.
        The allocation by the first mover is known to the second movers when they make decisions.
        The second mover will choose between option C and option D.

        4. Imprecise Signal
        Before making a decision, you will get imprecise private information called as a signal of the true value of the asset A.
        The size of the imprecision,  called as a noise, is equally likely drawn from the range of -$10 to $10.
        Suppose that the real value of Asset A is $130. Then, the range of the signal you can get is equally likely from $120 to $140.
        All signals are perfectly privately given. Hence, no one know the value of signal you get and one can have same or different value of signals from the other.
        Finally, the value of the signal cannot be smaller than the minimum value of the Asset A, $90, and the maximum value of the Asset B, $160.

        5. Experimental Procedure
        This experiment will be conducted as following for 20 rounds.
        Step 1: The first mover choose the number of tokens assigned to asset A
        Step 2: The first mover's allocation is known to two second movers within the same group.
        Step 3: The second movers choose between option C and option D

        6. Payoff
        One of the payoffs of total 20 rounds is randomly selected by computer and given to you.

        Suppose that the first mover chooses to allocate "k" number of tokens on the asset A and the real value of the asset is $X.
        The second movers' payoffs are determined as following:
        Case (1) If you choose option C and the other second mover in your group also chooses option C, then (k/10)*$X + ((10-k)/10)*$X.
        Case (2) If you choose option C and the other second mover chooses option D, then your payoff is (k/10)*$X + ((10-k)/10)*$X - $50.
        Case (3) If you choose option D, then you will get $100 regardless of others' choices.

        The first mover's payoff is determined as the average of the payoffs of two second movers in the same group.

        When k is 5 and $X is $130, then the possible list of payoffs are following:
        Second Movers:
        Case (1) (5/10)*$130 + ((10-5)/10)*$125 = $127.5
        Case (2) (5/10)*$130 + ((10-5)/10)*$125 - $50 = $77.5
        Case (3) $100

        First Mover:
        Case (1) ($127.5 + $127.5)/2 = $127.5
        Case (2) ($127.5 + $77.5)/2 = $102.5
        Case (3) ($100 + $100)/2 = $100
