    <p>
        Round {{ group.round_number }}
        You are the second mover.
        The first mover choose to allocate {{ group.portfolio }} tokens on asset A.
        You get $ {{ player.signal }} as a signal for the value of the asset A.
        A noise is equally likely ranging from -$10 to $10.
        Hence, the real value of the asset A is surely within the range from {{ player.lower }} to {{ player.upper }}.
        The value of the asset B is $125 surely.
        
        If you choose option C, then you will get payoffs between ${{ player.payoff_lower }} and ${{ player.payoff_upper }} when the other choose option C.
        Otherwise, you will getl dollars between ${{ player.payoff_lower_50 }} and ${{ player.payoff_upper_50 }}
        If you choose option D, then you will surely get $100
